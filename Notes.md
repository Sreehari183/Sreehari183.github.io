- An [expository article](../assets/p_adic_art.pdf) on p-adic integers which I used for a GSO Seminar at KU.
- A [note](../assets/Form_rings-1.pdf) on form rings and regular sequences (co)-written as part of a course (Math 996, Fall 2022).
- A [note](../assets/spnr.pdf) on the action of the symplectic group on the Siegel upper half-plane.
