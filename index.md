Hello! I am a third-year mathematics PhD student at the [University of Kansas (KU)](https://ku.edu/). Before coming to KU, I received my
BS-MS dual degree from [IISER Thiruvananthapuram](https://www.iisertvm.ac.in/), where I majored in mathematics and minored in physics.

My advisor is Prof. [Hailong Dao](https://hailongdao.github.io). I am interested in commutative algebra and algebraic geometry. I am currently
working on componentwise linear ideals, polarization, and some invariants related to points in projective space.
